# Video Files for Hero Section

To complete the hero section with full-screen video, you need to add the following files:

## Required Files:

1. **hero-video.mp4** - Main video file (MP4 format)
   - Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (looping)
   - Content: Smart ring lifestyle, technology, or abstract tech visuals

2. **hero-video.webm** - WebM format for better browser compatibility
   - Convert from your MP4 file for optimal performance

3. **video-poster.jpg** - Poster image shown before video loads
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Should represent the video content

## Video Content Ideas:
- Smart ring being worn in daily activities
- Technology/innovation visuals
- Abstract tech patterns with blue/cyan colors
- Lifestyle shots with smart devices
- Smooth, slow-motion footage

## File Placement:
Place all video files directly in the `public/` folder.

## Performance Tips:
- Keep video file size under 10MB for fast loading
- Use compression to optimize file size
- Consider adding `preload="metadata"` for better performance

## Fallback:
If no video files are found, the section will show a gradient background as fallback.
